  "about": {
    "description": "Hey, I am a Master’s student in Computer Engineering, currently strengthening my foundation in hardware design and systems. During my undergraduate studies, I concentrated on software development and machine learning, and toward the end of my degree, I shifted my focus toward controls and robotics—an intersection that allows me to combine both software expertise and hardware knowledge.<br><br>Outside of academics, I enjoy working on independent projects that broaden my technical skills. I also pursue personal interests such as coin collecting and language learning, which reflect my curiosity and commitment to continuous growth.<br><br>Right now, I am looking to get an industrial experience focused on the hardware side and therefore I am looking for a Spring/Summer internship for next year",
