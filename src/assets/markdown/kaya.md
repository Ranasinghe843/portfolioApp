# Machine Learning Intern
**KAYA Global** - *May 2023 - Dec 2023*

I worked on various ML concepts along with full stack development in the FERN stack of Firebase, Express, React, and Node. Right now I am integrating a custom Llama2 model with a Vector DB through LangChain for help and context through a chatbot. I set up several CI/CD pipelines with Kubernetes Engine in GCP to publish apps and Python services and configured services using Pub-Sub and Cloud Functions to transcribe and extract contexts through public LLMs.

## Key Contributions:
- **Machine Learning & Full Stack Development**: Implemented various machine learning algorithms and developed full stack applications using Firebase, Express, React, and Node.
- **Custom Llama2 Model Integration**: Integrated a custom Llama2 model with a Vector DB through LangChain to enhance chatbot capabilities.
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: Established multiple CI/CD pipelines using Kubernetes Engine in Google Cloud Platform (GCP) for deploying applications and Python services.
- **Service Configuration**: Configured services using Google Pub-Sub and Cloud Functions to enable transcription and context extraction through public LLMs.
- **Automation & Optimization**: Automated deployment processes and optimized resource management for scalable machine learning workflows.

## Technologies Used:
- **Machine Learning**: Python, TensorFlow, PyTorch, LangChain
- **Frontend**: React, HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express, Firebase
- **Cloud & DevOps**: Google Cloud Platform (GCP), Kubernetes, Pub-Sub, Cloud Functions, CI/CD Pipelines

This internship provided me with a comprehensive understanding of integrating machine learning models into production environments, as well as enhancing my skills in full stack development and cloud technologies.
