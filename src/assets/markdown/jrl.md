## Undergraduate Research Assistant
**Jain Research Laboratory** - *May 2022 - December 2022*

**Lab Director**: Dr. Neera Jain, Professor, School of Mechanical Engineering, Purdue University
**Mentor**: Michael Shanks (then Master’s student, currently working at Northrop Grumman)

This research experience provided me with invaluable skills in system-level optimization, control co-design, and advanced MATLAB techniques. Presenting at a prestigious conference and winning an award was an incredible learning opportunity, giving me insight into graduate-level research. As my first research experience, it cemented my interest in pursuing graduate studies, deepening my knowledge, and contributing to engineering advancements.

## Summer 2022 Term:
**Research Focus**:
Optimization of Thermal Energy Storage (TES) Device:
-	Participated in the Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship (SURF) program.
-	Optimized the design of a TES device, part of a thermal management system (TMS) for aircraft electronics.
-	Analyzed and understood the TMS and TES simulation models created in MATLAB, distributed across different GitHub repositories.
-	Optimized TES device dimensions by simulating with the entire TMS, incorporating effects of the heat exchanger and water tank variations.
-	Employed various optimization algorithms from MATLAB’s Global Optimization Toolbox, identifying the most effective one.
-	Utilized MATLAB’s Parallel Computing Toolbox to expedite optimization by distributing computations across multiple cores.
**Key Findings**:
-	Demonstrated the significant difference in TES design optimization independently versus system-level, highlighting the superior performance of system-level optimization.

## Fall 2022 Term:
**Extended Research**:
Control Co-Design of Thermal Management System:
-	Continued research to perform a control co-design of the TMS.
-	Conducted sensitivity analysis on TES geometric parameters and controller parameters affecting heat load management performance.
-	Applied the developed optimization algorithm to determine optimal geometric and controller parameters for TES under constant and variable heat loads.
-	Compared TES designs from control co-design with those designed independently, showcasing enhanced performance in handling variable heat loads.

## Achievements:
-	Presented research at the iTherm 2023 IEEE conference.
-	Won the best poster award in the system-level thermal management track.
Documentation:
-	Documented both summer and fall research projects in a technical paper using Overleaf LaTeX.
