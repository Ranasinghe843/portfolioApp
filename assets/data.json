    "description": "Hey there, I'm just a Computer Engineering senior at Purdue University who's seriously into Machine Learning and all things robotics. Right now, I'm on the hunt for gigs in Software Engineering, Data Science/Analytics, or anything that involves tinkering with robots and embedded systems. I've got this mix of skills from messing around on my own and diving deep into some cool research projects. When I'm not knee-deep in code, you'll find me at the karting track, binge-watching movies, or geeking out over my coin collection. Come take a peek at my portfolio to see how I've been rolling in the tech world!",
